/*
Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task 
in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers 
differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually 
differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his 
answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds 
one that is different in evenness, and return a position of 
this number.

! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, 
which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)

Examples:

iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the 
rest of the numbers are even

iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the 
rest of the numbers are odd

*/

function iqTest(numbers){
  var evenPosition;
  var oddPosition;
  var numArr = numbers.split(" ");
  var countOdd = 0;
  var countEven = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < numArr.length; i++) {
    if (numArr[i] % 2 == 0) {
      countEven += 1;
      evenPosition = i + 1;
    }
    else {
      countOdd += 1;
      oddPosition = i + 1;
    }
  };
  
  if (countOdd === 1) {
    return oddPosition;
  }
  else {
    return evenPosition;
  }
